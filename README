Intially we take the integer input from the user that whether he wants to play with other user/computer
We will design the grid for both the parts similarly and represented the empty places using space :' '.
1.For user:
  We will take the input of the position that the player wants to fill
 and then check whether such position exists and it is empty .If it is empty then we will fill
 with X for player 1 and O for player 2.Then we will check for the state of the game along with filing the places
 if it gets completed then will print the results.
2.For computer:
  similarly we will take input for this format and then check whether there is a chance to occupy the center
and we will prevent the win of opponent by one step and try to win over one step.

I have completed execution of the game by 3 classes
one for the representation and making movement for the pieces
second for the computer making moves according to our boardgrid
last one is for merging and executing classes.


For running the program:
1.enter 0 for dual player or 1 for playing with computer
2.positioning in the grid is  1 2 3
                              4 5 6
                              7 8 9
3.For playing with person,enter the position of the grid occordingly.First enter player 1's input and then grid will print and then enter
  player 2
4.Complete the game for printing results(only for Draw case).Results display which player has won the game
5,For playing with computer,you have to enter the input similarly as in dual player,but computer play as player 2
  along with grid position,we also print coordinates of computer position for better understanding
6.We will print the results at the end of the game.
